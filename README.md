House Price Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms. The project is built in Python using popular data science libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. By leveraging historical housing data, this model predicts the future prices of homes, aiding in better decision-making for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

Features

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and prepared using techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistics are used to understand the relationship between various features and housing prices.
Modeling: Several machine learning models are trained, tested, and compared, including:
Linear Regression
Random Forest
Decision Trees

Evaluation: Models are evaluated using performance metrics such as:
RÂ² score
Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Technologies Used
Python: Core language used for data manipulation, modeling, and evaluation.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
matplotlib/seaborn: For creating visualizations of the data and model results.

Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can open and run the Jupyter Notebook file House_price_prediction.ipynb to execute the code. The notebook guides you through data exploration, model building, and evaluation.

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook House_price_prediction.ipynb

Results
The best-performing model achieved around 80% accuracy using the Random Forest algorithm. This model was able to predict house prices with good reliability, making it a suitable approach for this problem.
